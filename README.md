# MegaSena Games Sorter
Mega Sena is a brasilian game, then six numbers between _1 and 60 are raffled_. 
But you can make each game choosing with between 6 and 15 numbers

## Objective
I made an app to raffle how many games you want, with how many numbers you want.
And ensure then the game has never been raffled before

## APP Development
I used pandas, streamlit frameworks to made the app
- Pandas:
> For data processing and get an list with all the games raffled before

- Strealit:
> For interactive, pretty and easy to made interface 

## How to run local
- download the .py files
- install the dependences with ``pip install -r requiriments.txt``
- run command ``streamlit run main.py``
